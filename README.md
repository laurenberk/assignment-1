I am majoring in environmental studies, I am interested in pursuing a career in wildlife conservation, environmental consulting, and environmental data analysis. I am taking this course to strengthen my coding and data analysis skills. My hobbies include listening to Taylor Swift, photography, bird watching, and working at my part-time retail job.
